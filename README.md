# GAECDS: Drug Synergy Prediction
This branch reproduces the implementation of GAECDS, Graph Auto Encoder and Convolutional neural network for Drug Synergy prediction.

## Dependencies and Installation
### Conda Environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate gaecds
```

### Clone Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/JDACS4C-IMPROVE/GAECDS.git
cd GAECDS
git checkout original-reproduce
```

### Download Original Data

The original data files necessary for this implementation are provided in this repository. Please refer to the `data/` directory for the original data files.


## Running the Model

**Usage**:
```
python code/GAECDS.py 
```  

**Output**: 

The model and results generated by this script are saved in the current directory where the command was executed.

*Note: The current implementation does not utilize GPU acceleration. All computations are performed on the CPU. If GPU support is required, modifications to the code are necessary to ensure tensors and models are explicitly moved to a CUDA device.*

## Results

The paper's results are stored in the `results/` directory.

For evaluation, the output from running the above command can be compared to **Table 2** in  
[*Predicting Drug Synergy and Discovering New Drug Combinations Based on a Graph Autoencoder and Convolutional Neural Network*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12539-023-00558-y).
